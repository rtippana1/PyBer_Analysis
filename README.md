# PyBer analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project is to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualizations about the data.I have written python scripts using pandas library in jupyter note book and  matplotlib  to create a variety of charts to show case the relationship between the type of the city and number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of the total fares,drivers and riders per city.The analysis and visualizations that i have produced will help PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.


### Results
- Total rides for each city type.
    - Rural        125
    - Suburban     625
    - Urban        162
- Total drivers for each city type.
   - Rural         78
   - Suburban     490
   - Urban       2,405
- Total amount of fares for each city type.
   - Rural        $4,327.93
   - Suburban    $19,356.33
   - Urban       $39,854.38
- Average fare per ride for each city type.
   - Rural       $34.62
   - Suburban    $30.97
   - Urban       $24.52
- Average fare per driver for each city type.
   - Rural       $55.47
   - Suburban    $39.50
   - Urban       $16.57

#### Summary

- There are way less number of drivers in rural cities and it would be a good idea to have more drivers in rural areas .
- The Average fare per ride in rural cities is high and by reducing the prices per ride we can make ride sharing affordable .
- The number of rides taken in rural cities is also low and by having more drivers and reducing the price we can make the ride share more accessible .
